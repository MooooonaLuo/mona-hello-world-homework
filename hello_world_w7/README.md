# Setup
This project uses P5 to capture live video. The user select a physical object, which would be projected as a bar on the screen, to play the pong game.

# Approach
Clicking any object in the video to catch its color. The position of the rectangle is decided by the average locations of pixels with the color selected.

# Challenge
Before this project, I tried to apply a sketch that detect motion and generate a circle that tracking the body part that is moving. However, I would not be able to create a circle like this.
